### District Summary

* Created a snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* Created an overview table that summarizes crucial metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Created a table that highlights the bottom five performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Created a table that lists the average Math Score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Created a table that lists the average Reading Score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Created a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use four appropriate bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

*Grouped schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Grouped schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
